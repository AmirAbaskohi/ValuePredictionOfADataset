# ValuePredictionOfADataset
In this project we are going to predict some missing value of a dataset using pandas, scipy, and other python libraries like these.

# Introduction:

In this assignment we are going to use some python modules to fix defects in a dataset. Here we need some statistical calculation to predict values that are unknown in our dataset to complete dataset.

# Description:
First there is a csv file that is our dataset. This dataset has some numerical and some categorical data. For prediction we need those numerical data. First there is an introduction to dataset. Using some pandas method we can see, get information, and change the dataset. After reading and modifying some dataset, we zoom on numerical data and normalize them. Now using those normal data and their plot we should choose parameter for predict unknown values and predict them.

# Requirements:
For running the app you need an interpretor for python .ipynb files. You can use "Google Colab" or "jupyter notebook".

If you are not using online interpretors such as Google Colab you need to install some python modules. For this use below commands:

```bash
pip install pandas
```

```bash
pip install scipy
```

```bash
pip install matplotlib
```
